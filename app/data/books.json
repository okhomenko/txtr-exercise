Time and again her nephew, Michael Marcinkus the grocer, has tried to help - but Rosa remains unknowable, hushed inside her hulk. On the day of the St Patrick's Day Parade, Rosa is in a terrible accident. While she lies in hospital, Mr Marcinkus visits her squalid apartment and unearths something remarkable from the monstrous piles of junk: two glittering ruby slippers, relics of Hollywood history. How on earth does decrepit old Rosa come to own such treasure? And what is to be done with it now? Rosa's 'Ruby Millions' soon become an irresistible beacon for the misplaced hopes and darkest desires of an unforgettable cast of characters. But in the hunger to possess the prize, will anyone stop to learn the incredible story of the woman to whom they once belonged? <i>The Ruby Slippers</i> is a rare and moving fantasia of hidden treasures, forgotten histories, lost connections, and our search for true meaning.",

He is a quiet, humble man who---after great suffering---acquires a rare and mystical gift of sensing GodвЂ™s Oneness in all things. But for the past 40 years the same haunting nightmare has tortured him---his hands are covered with blood; a child is screaming; a white house is burning, and in a large pine tree, a noose hangs in the moonlight. In the eyes of his one true friend, Eva, Cyril is perfect, and she has grown to love and admire him. He is the opposite of the things she hates about her imprisoned, alcoholic father. Then a stranger appears in the dark woods with the truth of the old manвЂ™s past. Cyril and Eva must journey deep in the forest to find the peace or death that awaits them.",

His basketball column for the San Francisco Chronicle is fueled by strong coffee, red wine, and anger, instead of the love he once had for the game. But his life is about to be changed by two women. One is Greta Eagleheart, whom he has known, worked with, and flirted with for three years; the other is a fierce old soul named Ruby Carmichael, who insists that Vic come watch her child play basketball as no one before him ever has. Although Vic resists at first, he finds himself inexorably drawn to the roughest neighborhood in Oakland - to Tillsbury Park, where many of the legendary great men got their start. <br/><br/>Spear Rashan Benedentes is a twenty-seven-year-old giant, a phenomenal athlete who soars effortlessly above the rim and commands the respect and awe of Tillsbury's savviest players. In spite of his protestations and bad back, Vic is thrust onto the court, where the game is as serious as life itself. While Spear teaches him a new understanding of sport, brotherhood, and family, Greta forces him to look deep within himself - for the courage to change and for the strength to play and love with all his heart.",
